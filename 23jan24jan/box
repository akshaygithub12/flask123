This property, in combination with ‘float’ and ‘position’, determines the type of box or boxes that are generated for an element. The values are as follows:

inline
    Inline boxes. 


block
    Block boxes. 


inline-block
    A block box, which itself is flowed as a single inline box, similar to a replaced element. The inside of an inline-block is formatted as a block box, and the box itself is formatted as an inline box. 

list-item
    One or more block boxes and one marker box. Marker boxes are defined in the Lists module [CSS3LIST]. If the Lists module is not ready, define the position of the marker and the list-style property here? Or refer to CSS 2.1 instead? 


run-in
    Either block or inline boxes, depending on context (see Run-in boxes). Properties apply to run-in boxes based on their final status (inline-level or block-level). 


compact
    Either block boxes or a marker box, depending on context (see Compact boxes). Properties apply to compact boxes based on their final status. 


table, inline-table, table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group, table-row, table-column-group, table-column, table-cell, table-caption
    See the Tables module [CSS3TBL]. 


ruby, ruby-base, ruby-text, ruby-base-group, ruby-text-group
    See the Ruby module [CSS3RUBY]. 
<template>
    See the Advanced Layout module [CSS3LAYOUT]. 
none
    This value causes an element to generate no boxes (i.e., the element has no effect on layout). Descendant elements do not generate any boxes either; this behavior cannot be overridden by setting the ‘display’ property on the descendants.
